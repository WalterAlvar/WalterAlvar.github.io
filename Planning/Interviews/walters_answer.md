# Interview to Walter (by Laura Ramirez)

## Tell me about yourself (Who you are and where do you came from, how is there?)
Hello, I'm Walter Alvarado, a former Tattoo Artists who wants to learn to code. I came from the Tropical El Salvador, in Central Am√©rica, there is a beautiful coastline with volcanics Black Sand beaches, and always warm waters.

## Where do you live now and what is the best of living there?
Right now I am living in Charleroi, as many people even Belgians despite this city, I love it because it's aesthetics, like in a Post Apocalyptic Mad Max movie, even if it's not as Old as other cities like Antwerp or Namur, It has a lot of history, in the times of Iron and Coal Mines it was a big and important city, but time flies and now all that splendor it is sleeping and collecting dust. But I still like it very much.

## What do you like to do in your free time?
Right now just to watch movies or series and watch videos of people coding

## Did you want to uses pictures of yourself in your site? *(since sometimes religion will not allow you and we must understand)*
Yes, even better I would love to use a Drawing or illustration of myself

## How many languages you speak? (do you plan to learn another and which will?)
Spanish is my mother language, but I speak a little bit of English, and currently I am learning French

## What are the goals you're trying to achieve?
To live happy, doing what I want, and never stop learning

## Why are those goals important?
Because for me it is the sense of life, right now more than ever I appreciate my time in this life

## What steps are you taking to achieve these goals?
Now I'm always searching and applying to scholarships for matters that I want to learn, Coding and build things with Arduino and Raspberries Pi it's a thing that I always wanted to learn but never had enough time, with Covid-19 Locking down my Tattoo Artists Career this is the exact moment to do it, and Thanks to the HYF chance I think I will make it possible soon 

## What are the biggest challenges that prevent you from achieving these goals?
In previous years I spent all my time Tattooing, even the weekends and holidays and that makes me happy but not necessarily fullfil my learning thirst and I was never push to get out of my comfort zone till now

## What have you done in the past to conquer these challenges? Did it work?
Yes, work hard and be humble, listening to the people who knows more and better

## What have you studied before decide learn about Web Development?
I have been studying Graphic Design for 3 years in Argentina, I wanted to become an Illustrator, but then I switched into Tattooing, later I Study Cinema in El Salvador, because I love movies but I was also a Bootcamp with an Oscar awarded director. And finally I was studying fine Arts (Drawing, Painting and Sculping)

## What areas of development are you most interested?
Web Design, Artificial Intelligence, domotique and robotics, Internet of Things, and Animations

## How do you think that you can mix your previuos experience with your new career as Web Developer?
I have noticed way more similarities than I thought between Web Development and Digital Graphics design, so I expect that help me in this new learning process
