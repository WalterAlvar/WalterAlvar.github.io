# Retrospective

## Strategy vs. Board

Take some time as a group to compare your Development Strategy to your Project Board.

-  What parts of your plan went as expected?
-  What parts of your plan did not work out?
-  Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?
-  Or remove extra steps?

## The Four Points

Your group will summarize your work by providing answers to these three questions. You can have more than one answer! You can answer with bullet points, paragraphs, links, images ... whatever is most clear.

-  **Stop Doing**: what mistakes did you make? did you miss a step? could your communication have been better? be specific!
-  **Continue Doing**: what went well that you should continue doing in the next project? be specific!
-  **Start Doing**: any good ideas you'd like to try out in the next project? be specific!
-  **Lessons Learned**: what cool things or general lessons has your team learned? This can be about anything, not just code!
